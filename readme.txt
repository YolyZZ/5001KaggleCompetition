Environment: Python 3

The packages needed for my code are as follow:
pandas, numpy, os, math, warnings, sklearn

To reproduce the result:
Run it in Jupyter Notebook by pressing "Run All" after altering the file pathes to correct ones.

The last output(prediction by RF) is my final result in Kaggle(scored 14.29342), which is the same as "test.csv".
